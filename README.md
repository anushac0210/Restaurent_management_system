The restaurant management system developed using postgresql and Django provides many features, including table
 allocations, order item notation, and automated bill calculations. It effectively handles table turnover
 by automatically freeing up tables after bill settlements, ensuring a smooth dining experience. The
 system caters to various roles, including manager, server, dining supervisor, chef, and customer,
 enabling them to fulfil their responsibilities seamlessly. Furthermore, it tracks menu updates and price
 changes based on demand, aiding in informed decision-making for the business.
